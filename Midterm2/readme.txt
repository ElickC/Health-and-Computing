I chose to implement the doctor/patient scheduling program due to recent events. There are two classes, the doctor class
has a dictionary of lists which are filled with dictionaries. Days of the week are the first key, 
the value is a list of pairs of patients and whey their seeing the doctor. The patient class functions
to store patient information and return a string of relevant information. I added 16 patients to one day
of the week for the doctor 'Bruce' on 'Friday' so if you try to add one more it won't let you. Please
let me know if you have any questions, it's been a crazy couple of weeks. Be well.
