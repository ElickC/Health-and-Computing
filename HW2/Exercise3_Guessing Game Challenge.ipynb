    "Write a program that picks a random integer from 1 to 100, and has players guess the number. The rules are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say \"OUT OF BOUNDS\"\n",
    "2. On a player's first turn, if their guess is\n",
    " * within 10 of the number, return \"WARM!\"\n",
    " * further than 10 away from the number, return \"COLD!\"\n",
    "3. On all subsequent turns, if a guess is \n",
    " * closer to the number than the previous guess return \"WARMER!\"\n",
    " * farther from the number than the previous guess, return \"COLDER!\"\n",
    "4. When the player's guess equals the number, tell them they've guessed correctly *and* how many guesses it took!\n",
